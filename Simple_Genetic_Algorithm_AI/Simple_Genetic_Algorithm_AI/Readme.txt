Research Project:	Genetic Algorithm
Student:			Andrew Ciervo

	This research project was done to reach a deeper understanding of genetic 
algorithms by doing a hands on program.  To accomplish goal, the first thing I had
to do was find a simple domain, which is using numbers 1 - 10, you split them into
two piles.  The first pile holds the numbers that need to be added together to get
the sum, and the second pile holds the numbers that need to be multiplied in order
to geth the product.  Once the piles equal the target sum and target product, then
we have found our solution.  Make a note that the piles do not hold duplicates of
the first and second pile.  An example set of piles would be; 2, 5, 3, 10, 6 and 
1, 9, 4, 8, 7.
	I believe I accomplished what I set out to achieve, as the concept was hard
to understand on paper when I was first setting up the functions.  I have most
of the variables I use as preprocessor macros to allow easy change for different 
targets, gene count, number count which is associated with cards, etc.  I have
doubled checked a few different number sets to make sure the solutions it found
did meet the solution rules for success.  I also have a high percentage for the
mutation and recombination variables so that when it runs, the solution will be
found within the tournament rounds, otherwise you would have to run the project
many times or increase the rounds to a massive number that is not ideal for the
small domain given.
